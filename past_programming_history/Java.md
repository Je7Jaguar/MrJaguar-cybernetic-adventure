# Java

My past history with java was short, around 1 month of experience. Where I went to learn Java was Udemy: they have loads of courses on everything.

The specific course I stumbled upon was this one https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/
It's a very good course, regularly updated. I got through 37% of the course, around 28 hours out of the 77 hours of videos that the course has to offer.
I was able to learn alot in those 28 hours though.

# The stuff I learned in the course

Variables, Datatypes and Operators |
Java Tutorial: Expressions, Statements, Code blocks, Methods |

OOP Part 1 - Classes, Constructors and Inheritance |
OOP Part 2 - Composition, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism |
