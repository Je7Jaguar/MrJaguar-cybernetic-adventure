# The problem is
Please find the readme file located in the home dir. Once found use the 
password that's in the file to connect to bandit1

# How I solved
I found the file using ls, I then used the cmd 'cat filename' to get the password needed to
connect to bandit1. Finally I used the ssh command from level 0 to connect
to bandit1

# CMD 
ssh -l bandit0 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
