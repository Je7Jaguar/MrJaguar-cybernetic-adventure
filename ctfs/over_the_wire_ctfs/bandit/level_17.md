# Problem 
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

# Solution
Simiply use the cmd diff to find the difference between the files, you will get to outputs so I just used grep with each output on the old passwords file to see which one wasn't there.

# Password
