# Problem
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level

# Solution
There's a file called sshkey.private which contains a ssh. You use it to connect to bandit14, ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost.

# Password/answer
