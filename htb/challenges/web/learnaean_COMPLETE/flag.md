# Problem
Your target is not very good with computers. Try and guess their password to see if they may be hiding anything! 

# Solution
The site tells us not to guess the password so lets do the opposite. I am going to use hydra, a great application for bruteforcing, i'm also going to use burpsuite to get some vitial information about the site so I can properly supply hydra with the correct parameters. I had to configure a few things before making burpsuite work, once I had it working I turned on intercept, and entered in a random password; from that I was able to find the invalid password form and a few other things. I then used the parameters I found and gave them to hydra:  
```hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt docker.hackthebox.eu http-post-form '/:password=^PASS^:Invalid password!' -s 51200```.  The -l is just the username, even though there isn't one we still have to supply it, the -P is the password list we want to use, "http-post-form", is the type of form, & finally the login failed parameters we got from burpsuite. After waiting a few moments I got the password "leonardo", but after entering it in I got a "Oops! Too slow", for some reason I didn't really know how to solve this part, so after searching around I found that burpsuite had a Reapeater option; so I turned on intercept again & then entered in the correct password & sent the request over to Reapeater. From there I was able to find the password hidden in the html of the site.
