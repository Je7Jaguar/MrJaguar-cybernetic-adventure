# Problem


# Solution
I found that the data in the file was base64, I decoded it and found that it was just a load of random chars, I started searching around the internet and somehow got myself to "crazy coding languages", from there I found "esoteric programming languages". I searched around for a bit on the wiki & found some code that looked really close the the code that I decoded from base64, the language was "Malbolge". So I found an online language decoder for Malbolge & I was able to get the flag.
