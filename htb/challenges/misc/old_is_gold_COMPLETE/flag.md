# Problem
Old algorithms are not a waste, but are really precious...

# Solution
The pdf is encrypted with a user password, so I ended up using pdfcrack to brute force the password; " pdfcrack -w rockyou.txt 0ld\ is\ g0ld.pdf". Password is jumanji69, after opening the pdf in xdg-open, I found there was some super small dots at the bottom of the file, it was morse code and it translated to, "R1PSAMU3LM0RS3".
