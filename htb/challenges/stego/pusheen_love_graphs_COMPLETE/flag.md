# Problem
 Pusheen just loves graphs, Graphs and IDA. Did you know cats are weirdly controlling about their reverse engineering tools? Pusheen just won't use anything except IDA. 

# Solution
Pusheen is a exe that prints out a "meme" img. In the probem desc we see that the creator talks about IDA, and that IDA is the only reverse engineering program that can run this program. I then opened up IDA with the program and got an error saying there was to many "nodes", and that the graph could not be displayed, the error also gave instructions on how to increase the amount of nodes that can be shown.

I did what the pop up told me to do, the graph then showed up with the flag.
