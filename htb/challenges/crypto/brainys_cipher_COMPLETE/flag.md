# Problem
Brainy likes playing around with esoteric programming. He also likes math and has therefore encrypted his very secure password with a popular encryption algorithm. Claiming that his password cannot be retrieved now, he has sent the ciphertext to some of his friends. Can you prove to Brainy that his password can actually be recovered? 

# Solution
I was just reading about encryptions and one of the encryptions I read about was called "brainfuck", so I knew exactly what encoding the cipher text was when I saw it.  plaintext,"

": decoding it from brainfuck gave us a new cipher text; RSA.

A faster way to decrypt a RSA encryption is to use dq & dp, the algorithm for that is, "Chinese remainder theorem". This is how to calculate m:
```
dP = (1/e) mod (p-1)
dQ = (1/e) mod (q-1)
qInv = (1/q) mod p

m1 = c^dP mod p
m2 = c^dQ mod q
h = qInv * (m1 - m2) mod p
m = m2 + h * q  ```
