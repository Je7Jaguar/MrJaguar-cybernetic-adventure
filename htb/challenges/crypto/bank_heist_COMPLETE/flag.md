# Problem
You get to the scene of a bank heist and find that you have caught one person. Under further analysis of the persons flip phone you see a message that seems suspicious. Can you figure out what the message to put this guy in jail?

# Solution
"Flip Phone", made me think T9 cipher, so I just searched for a decrypter and got the plaintext below.  
plaintext - "IF YOU ARE READING THE CIPHER YOU ARE OKAY YOUR SHARE OF THE HEIST IS IN YOUR HOUSE THE KEY TO THE LOCK IS BELOW GO TO PARIS GSV XLWV GL GSV HZU OLXP:TLIVGRIVNVMGUFMW!!"  
The last part of the paragraph is still messed up, so I started searching for substitution  ciphers since they are very common, I then found an alphabetical substitution that decrypted the last part: "THE CODE TO THE SAF LOCK:GORETIREMENTFUND!!".
