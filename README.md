# Stuff that has helped me and is helping me get to where I want to be

The first thing I can recommend is find a good community. Discord is a very good place to find amazing communities of programmers. Here are 2 discords that are great https://discord.gg/AqQvYD2 (Very much focused on CTFâ€™S and stuff involving that) | https://discord.gg/yFNE7uu (Overall a good place for most coding languages) Also some good youtubers are https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeW9qkBjo3zosnqUbG7CFw (John Hammond)

# Useful commands/debuggers for reverse engineering
Debuggers | radare2 and gdb are the best: radare2 has a sharp learning curve but is better overall.

ltrace will trace libraries (ltrace ./runnable). 
strace will trace functions and such. (strace ./runnable)
