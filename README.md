# My "adventure" of learning to hack
This repos will just be ctfs / wargames & challenges, I'l try my best to explain how to solve them. 

Recently started HTB so i'll be uploading writeups of retired machines


EDIT: It has been 2 months since the last update.. I kinda forgot about this repos; HTB has taken over my life lol, and i've just been doing machines, and uploading all the finished writups to a private repos, since alot of the machines I've been doing are active.. This is just a quick update, everything is going well, and i'm learning alot about hacking :) i'm also 15% off from Elite Hacker on HTB, so that's really cool..
I don't know when I'll be updating this repos again.
