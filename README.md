## This README.md will have a bunch of useful info and tips.

### Stuff that has helped me and is helping me get to where I want to be

**The first thing I can recommend is find a good community, discord is a very good place to find amazing communities of programmers, here are a few youtubers/discords.**

https://discord.gg/AqQvYD2 (Very much focused on CTFâ€™S and stuff involving that)  
https://discord.gg/yFNE7uu (Overall a good place for most coding languages)  
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeW9qkBjo3zosnqUbG7CFw (John Hammond)  
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w (LiveOverFlow)  

**Good sites to learn about hacking**

These two sites are very noob friendly.
