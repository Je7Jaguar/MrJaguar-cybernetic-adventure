# The problem is
There used to be a bunch of animals here, what did Dr. Xernon do to them?

# What I did
I downloaded the link provided, then used 'file filename' to figure out more about the file. I noticed it had a '.dd'  extension, a bit of googling tells me that 
the extension is a 'DiskDoubler'. Searched around and found a apt that recovers
deleted data on .dd file types. Ran the program that I found and found the deleted data.
