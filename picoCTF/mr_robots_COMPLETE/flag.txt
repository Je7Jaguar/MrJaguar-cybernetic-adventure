# Problem
Do you see the same things I see? The glimpses of the flag hidden away?

# Solution
I clicked the link and inspected the site for a bit. Couldn't find anything,
but I then it clicked. I need to go robotots.txt to check what's allowed and disallowed on the site.
Once I went there I saw that a certain url extension was disallowed. I went to the url that was disallowed and found the flag.

# Flag
picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_3lli0t_30de1}
