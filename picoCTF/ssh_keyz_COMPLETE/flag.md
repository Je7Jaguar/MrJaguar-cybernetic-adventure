# The problem is
As nice as it is to use our webshell, sometimes its helpful to connect directly to our machine. To do so, please add your own public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, using the webshell. The flag is in the ssh banner which will be displayed when you login remotely with ssh to with your username.

# How I solved it
Just went to my terminal and typed in 'ssh <username>@2018shell1.picoctf.com'. If you don't have a 
ssh you need to make one.
