# Problem
Looks like someone started making a website but never got around to making a login, but I heard there was a flag if you were the admin. 

# Solution
I was not able to find the solution on this one, I had a idea of what was needed, but no idea how to get there..
I found a good post on how to do this problem and the solution was to make a new cookie: named Admin with the value true.
