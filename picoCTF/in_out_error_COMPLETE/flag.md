# Problem
Can you utlize stdin, stdout, and stderr to get the flag from this program? You can also find it in /problems/in-out-error_3_9eb10797d687f70cfce62e7c9c2bdea6 on the shell server

# Solution
Just used  (echo "Please may I have the flag?" | ./in-out-error 1> /dev/null) to get the flag.. I couldn't really figure this out for some reason. So I looked it up; reason why I couldn't figure it out is because I've never used linux untell I started to hack, which was 2 months ago.. So I'm still learning alot.
