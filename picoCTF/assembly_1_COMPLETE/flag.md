# Problem
What does asm1(0x76) return? 

# Solution
I've been having a hard time with assembly, with this challenge I just went over all the assembly syntax to better understand it.
I also made a idea map of everything, which helped. Despite all that I still needed to look at the solution.. I'm not talking about just grabbing the answer, I found a pretty cool github repo that explained everything. Checking the answers helped me a load.. I know understand addresses :)
