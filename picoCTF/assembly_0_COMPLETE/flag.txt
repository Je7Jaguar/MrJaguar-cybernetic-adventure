# The problem is
What does asm0(0xb6,0xc6) return? Submit the flag as a hexadecimal value (starting with '0x')

# How I solved it
First I checked the hints and started to read all about assembly. It's a long read, but it will be needed
in hacking and futher on in the ctf's. After reading all about it and understanding the gest of the
language I was able to determine that all the program does is take two parameters and output the 
second paramter given.

# Flag
picoCTF{0xc6}
