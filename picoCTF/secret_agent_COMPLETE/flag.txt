# Problem
Here's a little website that hasn't fully been finished. But I heard google gets all your info anyway.

# Solution
I know some about user agents so after seeing the error on the website provided, I started to search 
"How to change user agents". I then found a chrome extension that changes your user agent. Finally I found the google user agent and set that as my agent then reloaded the website and was given the flag.
