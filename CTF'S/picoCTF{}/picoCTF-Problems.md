# Website https://picoctf.com | https://2018game.picoctf.com/problems

Where my adventure begin. The site I listed above has a game version and a plain problem version; I started on the plain problem version.
There's a load of problems to do, so I just started working on them. When I got stuck I just searched up the words that I didn't 
understand. Then I started to link it all together, for instance."**If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII?**" This was one of the first problems that I came upon.

I didn't know what "ASCII was or 0x41" So I searched up each one and figured out what each one was. Then I did a bigger search "Hexa to ASCII converter" found the answer pretty quick. I won't be explaining the upcoming problems like this. Just wanted to give a good example.
