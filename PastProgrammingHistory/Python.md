# Python

Current/past history with python. I've been learning python for a month, and I am still learning it. Currently i'm going through a course on Udemy. Name of the course is https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/
It's a really fun course with many real world applications. I am half way through the course and i'm still enjoying it
